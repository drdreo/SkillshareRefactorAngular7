This repo is the related project for the class available at: [Skillshare_updateLink](shillshare.com)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Class Project
### Getting Started
You can either clone this repository and work locally in your prefered editor / IDE or dive right into it using the awesome [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/drdreo/SkillshareRefactorAngular7) editor and fork the project. 
If you run into any issues make sure you are using the latest version of Chrome since it's the most reliable browser for web development.
#### Local Setup
##### Requirements
- Node.js v10.15.1
- npm v6.4.1

##### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


### Submission
I would love to see your project in the [gallery_updateLink](shillshare.com) and others would definitely appreciate a filled project gallery.
The easiest way is to submit a link to your forked Stackblitz (don't forget to share the Editor, not the App URL) or your favorite online editor. You can also zip your folders (but exclude your node_modules) and upload them somewhere and share a link to it.
